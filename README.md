# maplume

maplume is an easy to use and to install word tracker for novel writers.

Easy to use: not many features, keep it simple, but beautiful.

Easy to install means: it can be installed on windows, mac, or linux in one click, and automatically updates with new version.

The word tracker has the following features:

- it handles multiple project
- a project is characterized by a start date, end date, and a target number of words (modifiable any time)
- the typical routine is to give the number of words written and a new datapoint is displayed in a nice plot that shows the target (a linear line between (start date, 0) and (end date, target number of words).
- the UI also displays statistics
- it is a motivating tool: a nice random message gives courage depending on the trend
- the UI/UX must be world class
- the most important feedback is the plot but it should be possible to see the data rows if asked (don't show by default)
- it should be possible to import/export data, and potentially connect to a google account or a microsoft account to store these data in the cloud

maplume is stored on github and should be downloadable from there.

We need a clean CI/CD pipeline to push new updates and allow users to automatically get them.

I want a donate button in the app linked to the sponsorship program of Github.
